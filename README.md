# CompGraphicsProject

## Overview

**CompGraphicsProject** is an advanced computer graphics project designed to explore and implement various rendering techniques and graphical algorithms. This project aims to provide an interactive platform for visualizing [specific concept, e.g., 3D models, lighting, shaders, animation, etc.] in a dynamic environment. It is developed with the intention of showcasing the practical application of computer graphics principles in [specific area, e.g., game development, simulations, education, etc.].

Key features include:
- [Key feature 1, e.g., Real-time rendering of 3D models]
- [Key feature 2, e.g., Shader-based lighting effects]
- [Key feature 3, e.g., Interactive user interface for model manipulation]

## Key Features and Functionality

### Interactive 3D Rendering
- **Real-Time Rendering**: The core of this project is its ability to render 3D models in real-time, providing dynamic visualization of computational graphics.
- **Shader Effects**: Custom shaders are implemented for realistic lighting, shadows, and materials, enabling advanced visual effects.
- **User Interactivity**: Users can manipulate the models and observe real-time changes in the scene via mouse or keyboard controls.

### Background Music
This project includes a carefully selected background music track that enhances the overall user experience. The music is intended to complement the graphical features and create an immersive environment.

- **Composer**: [Veronah Kartel]
- **Track Name**: [M1]
- **License**: [MIT License, Creative Commons]

## Usage

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Rotate and zoom in/out the scene.
- **Keyboard**:
  - `W`: Move forward
  - `S`: Move backward
  - `A`: Strafe left
  - `D`: Strafe right
  - [Other controls]

### Visual Features
- **Model Manipulation**: Users can load different 3D models and interact with them in the viewport.
- **Scene Lighting**: Real-time adjustment of scene lighting using different lighting models such as point lights, directional lights, and spotlights.
