## **How It Works**

### Game Elements
1. **Maze:**
   - The game maze is structured as a grid (15x20 cells), built using a 2D array (`MAZE`).
   - Walls (`1`) block your path, while clear routes (`0`) let you move freely.

2. **Pellets:**
   - Scattered across the maze at the start of the game.
   - Each pellet increases your score.

3. **Ghosts:**
   - Programmed to chase you using adaptive algorithms.
   - Their speed and count vary based on the selected difficulty.

4. **Maze Hero (aka You):**
   - Moves continuously in the chosen direction.
   - Cannot pass through walls (because physics, duh).

### Technical Details
- **Canvas API:** Handles the rendering of the maze, Pac-Man, ghosts, and animations.
- **JavaScript Classes:** Simplifies ghost logic and pellet behavior.
- **Audio API:** Provides seamless background music for immersive gameplay.

## **Tips and Tricks**

1. **Stay Ahead of the Ghosts:**
   - Always plan your moves. Ghosts are faster than you think.

2. **Corner Strategy:**
   - Use corners to throw ghosts off their path.

3. **Master Easy Before Moving Up:**
   - Learn the maze and ghost behavior on Easy mode before trying Medium or Hard.

4. **Be Persistent:**
   - Ghosts may get you, but they can‚Äôt stop you from hitting that **Try Again** button.
