# **WebGL Applications: Interactive Graphics by Group 5**

Welcome to **Group 5's WebGL Applications Project**! This repository contains our interactive graphics application developed using WebGL. Our aim is to harness the power of WebGL to create a captivating and feature-rich 3D experience with dynamic visuals, animations, and music.

---

## **Project Overview**

Our project is an **interactive 3D game** featuring:
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and dynamic movements for an engaging experience.
- **Music**: Background music and sound effects to enhance interactivity.
- **Dynamic UI**: A navy blue-themed interface for an elegant and modern look.
- **Obstacles**: Challenges that make gameplay interesting and immersive.
- **3D Visuals**: Layered objects, textures, and lighting to bring the environment to life.
- **Interactive Elements**: A food object that changes color dynamically.

This project showcases teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity as we explore the potential of WebGL.
